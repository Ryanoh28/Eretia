Eretia is a continent that borders the lands controlled by monsters. Border Town is a fortified town built on the border of Eretia and the monster controlled regions 
to protect against any monster incursions into Eretia. It's also where adventurers go to venture into the monster regions. Many years in the past there was an event
now known as The Great Beast Tide, when millions of monsters flooded over the border and devoured anything in it's past like a tidal wave, hence the name.

Humanity were only able to fight back due to the sacrifice of many heroes.
